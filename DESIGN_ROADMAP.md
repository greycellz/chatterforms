## ðŸš€ Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: User Management & Authentication

#### 1.1 Authentication Architecture

**Security Decision: Server-Side Sessions vs JWT**
- **Recommendation: Server-Side Sessions** for enhanced security
- **Rationale**: Better for HIPAA compliance, easier to revoke access, more control over session management
- **Implementation**: Redis or Firestore for session storage

**Email Provider Options:**
1. **SendGrid** (Recommended): Reliable, good deliverability, HIPAA-compliant
2. **AWS SES**: Cost-effective, high deliverability
3. **GCP Built-in**: Limited features, not recommended for production
4. **Resend**: Modern alternative with good developer experience

**SSO Integration:**
- **Google OAuth**: Using GCP Identity Platform (already in GCP ecosystem)
- **Microsoft OAuth**: Azure AD integration for enterprise users
- **Implementation**: OAuth 2.0 with proper state management

#### 1.2 User Management Design

**Database Schema (Firestore Collections):**
```typescript
// Users collection
users: {
  id: string
  email: string
  passwordHash: string
  name: string
  emailVerified: boolean
  createdAt: Timestamp
  lastLoginAt: Timestamp
  status: 'active' | 'suspended' | 'pending'
  twoFactorEnabled: boolean
  twoFactorSecret?: string
}

// Sessions collection
sessions: {
  id: string
  userId: string
  token: string
  expiresAt: Timestamp
  ipAddress: string
  userAgent: string
  createdAt: Timestamp
}

// OAuth connections
oauthConnections: {
  id: string
  userId: string
  provider: 'google' | 'microsoft'
  providerUserId: string
  accessToken: string
  refreshToken: string
  expiresAt: Timestamp
}

// Email verification tokens
emailVerificationTokens: {
  id: string
  userId: string
  token: string
  expiresAt: Timestamp
  used: boolean
}

// Password reset tokens
passwordResetTokens: {
  id: string
  userId: string
  token: string
  expiresAt: Timestamp
  used: boolean
}
```

#### 1.3 Authentication Flow Design

**Sign Up Flow:**
```
1. User enters email, password, name
2. Password validation (strength, common passwords)
3. Create user record (password hashed with bcrypt)
4. Send verification email
5. Redirect to email verification page
6. User clicks email link â†’ verify email â†’ redirect to dashboard
```

**Login Flow:**
```
1. User enters email/password
2. Rate limiting check (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
3. Verify credentials
4. Create session (server-side)
5. Set secure HTTP-only cookie
6. Redirect to dashboard
```

**SSO Flow:**
```
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google/Microsoft"
2. Redirect to OAuth provider
3. User authorizes ChatterForms
4. OAuth callback with authorization code
5. Exchange code for access token
6. Get user info from provider
7. Create/update user record
8. Create session and redirect to dashboard
```

**Password Reset Flow:**
```
1. User clicks "Forgot Password"
2. Enter email address
3. Rate limiting check
4. Generate secure reset token (32 chars, 1 hour expiry)
5. Send reset email with secure link
6. User clicks link â†’ enter new password
7. Validate password strength
8. Update password and invalidate all sessions
9. Redirect to login
```

#### 1.4 Security Implementation

**Rate Limiting:**
- Login attempts: 5 per 15 minutes per IP
- Password reset requests: 3 per hour per email
- Email verification: 3 per hour per email
- API endpoints: 100 requests per minute per user

**Password Security:**
- Minimum 8 characters
- Require uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- Check against common password lists
- bcrypt with salt rounds of 12

**2FA Implementation:**
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- QR code generation for authenticator apps
- Backup codes for account recovery
- Optional for free tier, required for Pro/HIPAA plans

**Session Security:**
- Secure HTTP-only cookies
- CSRF protection
- Session timeout (24 hours for free, 7 days for paid)
- Automatic logout on password change

#### 1.5 User Onboarding (Inspired by Lovable/ChatGPT)

**Welcome Flow:**
```
1. Email verification completion
2. Welcome modal with platform overview
3. Quick tutorial (3 steps):
   - Step 1: "Try creating a form" â†’ Pre-filled example
   - Step 2: "Customize your form" â†’ Styling demo
   - Step 3: "Publish and share" â†’ Publishing demo
4. Skip option available
5. Redirect to dashboard with example form
```

**Dashboard Onboarding:**
- **Progress indicator**: Shows onboarding completion
- **Tooltips**: Contextual help for new features
- **Example forms**: Pre-built templates to explore
- **Quick actions**: Prominent buttons for common tasks

**Mobile Onboarding:**
- **Swipe tutorial**: Mobile-specific gesture explanations
- **Voice guidance**: Optional audio explanations
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show features gradually

#### 1.6 Integration with Existing Codebase

**Minimal Changes Required:**
- Add user context to existing components
- Wrap form operations with user authentication
- Add user ID to existing Firestore collections
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing forms

**Authentication Middleware:**
```typescript
// Add to existing API routes
const requireAuth = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const session = await getSession(req)
  if (!session) {
    return NextResponse.redirect('/login')
  }
  return session
}
```

**User Context Provider:**
```typescript
// Add to existing dashboard layout
<UserProvider>
  <DashboardContent />
</UserProvider>
```
